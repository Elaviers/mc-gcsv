## [Official] Gamma Cagadota Minecraft Server Tweaks
This is a fabric server mod consisting of some small minecraft server improvements *officially endorsed* by Gamma Cagadota

Currently it just does 2 things:
 - When you die the stuff you drop takes **way** longer to despawn (the default is like 4 hours but you can change it in the config file)
  - Implements a `/goto` command; basically tp but anyone can do it as long as the recipient agrees. Goto requests can be accepted with `/accept`, and the recipient may also specifiy if they'd like to `always` or `never` auto-accept goto requests from certain nerds
